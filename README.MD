# Blogger Gallery Helper

This helper tool will create a responsive gallery code for a set of links / images provided for your blog.

This tool is based on the original post from https://georgialoustudios.com/how-to-create-a-responsive-blogger-image-gallery/
I created this tool to help me handle several images and avoid the hassle of manipulating the HTML for each of them.

After you upload your images, just copy the generated content and use the tool to convert it to a final version of the html.
You will be required to add some styles to either the page, or the blog styles (if you are using several pages).
